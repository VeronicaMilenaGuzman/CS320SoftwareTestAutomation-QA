# CS320SoftwareTestAutomation-QA
To make sure my software is both functional and secure, I focus on clean coding, regular code reviews, and automated testing to catch bugs early. I also keep up with security best practices and use tools to scan for vulnerabilities. Understanding and incorporating user needs into my software involves actively listening to users through interviews or surveys, creating user stories, and seeking continuous feedback to refine the software according to their needs. When designing software, I start by clearly defining the goals and requirements. I then sketch out a high-level architecture, applying design principles to ensure the software is robust and maintainable. Through prototyping and iterative development, I explore various solutions, adapting based on feedback to meet user needs effectively.
